## Description

Create a timed multiple choice quiz. To create this quiz I used event listeners to respond to events like button clicks and the timer. I created easy transitions between screen views. I learned how to store and retrieve date from local storage. I also made it possible that the answers would be shuffled each time the quiz is played.  

### User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
